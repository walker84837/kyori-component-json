# Advanced Components

Once you've mastered the basics of creating simple text components, you can move on to the more advanced features of this library. This section will guide you through the powerful tools available for creating complex, interactive, and dynamic components.

We'll cover three main areas:

- **Component API**: You'll learn how to build components programmatically. While simple components can be created easily, the full API offers fine-grained control over every aspect of a component, from styling to events.

- **Dynamic components**: You'll learn how to create components on the fly. This is useful for features like chat systems, where content is generated based on user input or other runtime data.

- **Serialization**: Converting components to and from different string-based formats. This is fundamental for storing components or sending them over a network. We'll look at the MiniMessage format in specific, a popular and powerful way to represent components.
