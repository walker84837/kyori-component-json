# What is MiniMessage?

MiniMessage is a lightweight, human-friendly markup format designed for rich text. Instead of writing verbose JSON, you can use simple tags to apply colors, formatting, and even interactive events. For example, `<red>Hello, <b>World!</b></red>` is much easier to write and read than its JSON equivalent.

MiniMessage is particularly useful when:

- You're getting **user input**, allowing players or server administrators to easily format messages without needing to understand complex JSON.
- Writing **configuration files**, MiniMessage will simplify storing rich text in a more readable format.
- **Prototyping** by typing simple messages without boilerplate Rust code or complex JSON.
